# Sample Exam Question 2

Stacks

Stacks are collections with a prescribed behaviour called LIFO. An object is always added to the “top” of the stack. 
It is said to be “pushed onto” the stack. Access involves the removal of the top of the element of the stack (you cannot 
view only). It is said to be “popped from” the stack.

Stacks are fixed size, and ultimately an application can run out of memory. If this happens, it is called stack overflow. 
Conversely, an attempt to pop an element from an empty stack is called stack underflow.
