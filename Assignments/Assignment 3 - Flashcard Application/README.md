# Assignment 3 - Flashcard Application
A flashcard application. 

Flashcards are used to help some memorize a set of facts. The first
flashcard is revealed and the student attempts to answercorrectly. If
the answer is correct, this particular flashcard is set aside (so that 
the student is not askedsomething that they already know again) and the 
student gains a point in their total score. Instead, if theanswer is
incorrect, this flashcard is re-inserted, randomly, back into the deck
of flashcards, and no point is earned. Play continues until all flashcards
are correctly answered, or until the student tires and quits.
